# Hello there :wave: :smile:

## Who am I:question: 
My name is Anna Park, & I am a former Fashion Designer turned Software Developer. I graduated from Parsons School of Design in New York City :mortar_board: & worked in the fashion industry before returning to Southern California :sunny: to pursue a career in tech. My interest in coding stemmed from wanting to integrate both visual & functional aspects together to successfully build a project. As new days present new challenges, I always continue to work hard to improve my skillsets from the days before. :sparkles:  

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on:
 1. Creating additional features for my full-stack application project, Solitudal Thoughts.
 2. Algorithms on CodeSignal & LeetCode.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning & reviewing:
 1. React.js
 2. Bootstrap

## Fun Facts: :eyes:
- I'm left handed. That being said, I have the coolest & possibly the weirdest handwriting. :raised_hand_with_fingers_splayed:	
- Back in my art school days, I used to love drawing any kind of fruit to calm me down. It still stays with me until this very day. :woman_artist:
- Big fan of true crime documentaries. :nerd_face:	
- No matter what the weather is, I only drink iced coffee. :ice_cube:	
- When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring museums, taking strolls at the beach or trying new dessert shops!
